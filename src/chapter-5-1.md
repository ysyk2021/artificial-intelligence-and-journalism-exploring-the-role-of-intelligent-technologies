In addition to automated reporting and writing, artificial intelligence (AI) is also being used to help journalists gather and verify news. From social media monitoring to fact-checking, AI-powered tools are helping journalists to quickly and accurately report on breaking news events.

In this chapter, we will explore some of the key AI-powered journalism solutions currently being used in news gathering and verification.

Social Media Monitoring
-----------------------

Social media has become an important source of breaking news coverage, with many people turning to platforms like Twitter and Facebook for up-to-the-minute information on important events. However, monitoring social media can be a daunting task for journalists, particularly during times of crisis.

AI-powered social media monitoring tools, such as Dataminr and Storyful, help journalists to quickly identify and verify breaking news events on social media. These tools use machine learning algorithms to scan social media platforms for relevant information and alert journalists to breaking news events in real-time.

Image and Video Analysis
------------------------

Images and videos can be powerful tools for conveying information about breaking news events. However, verifying the authenticity of these visual assets can be a difficult and time-consuming process.

AI-powered image and video analysis tools, such as [Veracity.ai](http://Veracity.ai), are helping journalists to quickly and accurately verify visual assets. These tools use advanced computer vision algorithms to analyze images and videos for signs of manipulation or alteration, helping journalists to ensure that their coverage is based on accurate and authentic information.

Fact-Checking
-------------

Fact-checking is an important part of the journalistic process, but it can be a time-consuming and resource-intensive task. AI-powered fact-checking tools, such as Factmata and Full Fact, help journalists to quickly and accurately verify claims made in news articles and other forms of media.

These tools use natural language processing algorithms to analyze text and identify potentially inaccurate or misleading information. This can help journalists to quickly identify and correct errors in their reporting, improving the accuracy and credibility of their coverage.

Conclusion
----------

AI-powered news gathering and verification tools have the potential to revolutionize the way that journalists report on breaking news events. From social media monitoring to fact-checking, these technologies are helping journalists to quickly and accurately report on important events, providing readers with high-quality, informative, and engaging news coverage.

As these technologies continue to evolve, it is important for journalists and news organizations to stay up-to-date with the latest developments and to carefully consider the ethical and legal implications of their use. By doing so, we can ensure that AI is used in a responsible and ethical manner to advance the field of journalism and provide readers with high-quality, informative, and engaging news coverage.
